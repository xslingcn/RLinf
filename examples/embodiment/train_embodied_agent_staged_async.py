"""Async staged entry point for embodied RL with a VLM planner.

This script provides the staged YAM/TOPReward runtime on the async PPO stack.
It uses the same staged orchestration as ``train_embodied_agent_staged.py``
but forces the async components:

- ``AsyncPPOEmbodiedRunner``
- ``AsyncPPOEmbodiedFSDPActor``
- ``AsyncMultiStepRolloutWorker``
- ``AsyncEnvWorker``

Use this script for staged configs with an explicit ``_async`` suffix:

- ``yam_ppo_openpi_async`` — TOPReward only (``subtask_interval: 0``)
- ``yam_ppo_openpi_topreward_async`` — TOPReward + optional subtask planning
- ``yam_ppo_openpi_desktop_async`` — desktop-topology staged variant

These configs are auto-selected here by the standard launchers whenever the
config name ends in ``_async``.
