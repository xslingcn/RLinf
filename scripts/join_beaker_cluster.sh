# join_beaker_cluster.sh — Join a Beaker Ray cluster from the local desktop and run training.
#
# This is the second half of a desktop-driven training workflow:
#   1. submit_yam_beaker_cluster.sh starts a Beaker job with Ray head + GPUs (idle).
#   2. This script joins the cluster from the desktop and runs training locally.
#
# NOTE: The canonical YAM configs (yam_ppo_openpi, yam_ppo_openpi_topreward) use
# train_embodied_agent_marl.py with RobotWorker + RemoteRobotClient and
# cluster.num_nodes: 1. For those configs, use submit_yam_training.sh instead —
# it runs everything on Beaker.
#
# This script is useful when you have a custom config with env/yam (direct YAMEnv)
# and a multi-node cluster layout that puts the env worker on the desktop.  In that
# case the desktop joins as a Ray worker node and the training script drives the env
# directly without gRPC.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/join_beaker_cluster.sh --head-ip <tailscale-ip> [OPTIONS] [-- HYDRA_OVERRIDES...]

Usage: bash scripts/join_beaker_cluster.sh --head-ip <IP> [OPTIONS] [-- HYDRA_OVERRIDES...]

Join a Beaker Ray cluster from the local desktop and run training.

The training script runs locally. The config's native placement puts actor/rollout
on the Beaker GPUs and the env worker on this desktop (with direct YAMEnv access).

Required:
  --head-ip IP          Beaker container Tailscale IP (from Beaker logs)

Options:
  --config NAME         Hydra config name (default: yam_ppo_openpi)
  --model-path PATH     Model checkpoint path
  --task DESC           Task description (default: "pick and place")
  --node-rank N         Desktop node rank (default: 1)
  --ray-port PORT       Ray port (default: 6379)
  --help                Show this help

Extra Hydra overrides can be passed after '--':
  bash scripts/join_beaker_cluster.sh --head-ip 100.x.y.z -- algorithm.update_epoch=2

Examples:
  # Custom 2-node config with env/yam (desktop at rank 1, Beaker GPUs at rank 0)
  bash scripts/join_beaker_cluster.sh \
      --head-ip 100.64.1.2 \
      --config my_custom_yam_config \
      --node-rank 1 \
      --model-path thomas0829/folding_towel_pi05 \
      --task "pick and place"
